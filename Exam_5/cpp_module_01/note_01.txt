1.
Using Map container : so can't have dupicated keyword, before learnSpell or
learnTargetType should check if it exits in the map already.

ASpell and ATarget are similar;

2. Dummy and Fwoosh are similar;

3. Add new attribute map into warlock and three new functions into Warlock:
	learnSpell, forgetSpell, launchSpell

	after adding the map, remember to delete it in the deconstrutor.

4. For testing:
	add extra launch and forget a non-existant spell test cases into main.
